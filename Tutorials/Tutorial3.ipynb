As a consequence, any set of $N$ points on the short line may be inflated into a legal configuration of $N$ pins on the initial washing line of length $L$. This procedure is rejection-free, and is implemented in the program below. It is followed by the program which generates the histogram of the positions of the centers of the pins, as generated by the rejection-free algorithm. Its profile may be compared with the profile presernted in the lecture, generated with the naive algorithm. The outputs are identical, but the naive algorithm took a lot more time than the rejection-free version."

    "The pair-correlation function for this system oscillates inside a decaying envelope, and converges towards a constant value for large values of $|x-x'|$. The figure shown below the pair-correlation function illustrates this decay on a logarithmic scale. The close-to-linear behavior confirms that the oscillations decay exponentially: $\\pi(x, x') - K \\propto exp(-\\dfrac{|x-x'|}{\\xi})$. $\\xi$ represents the correlation length between pins. for $\\eta=0.8$, we have $\\xi \\simeq 2.4$, while for $\\eta=0.9$, $\\xi \\simeq 6.4$, and $\\xi$ exhibits a dramatic increase for $\\eta = 0.95$: $\\xi \\simeq 26.2$. At distances larger than $\\xi$, the system is homogeneous. The existence of such a correlation distance is the very definition of a liquid phase.\n",

    "It can actually be shown that the correlation length diverges as the density goes to 1. This corresponds to the fact that the partition function is analytic for all values of $\\eta$, but not for $\\eta=1$, and that the only \"phase transition\" in this system happens when $L=2N\\sigma$, with a close-packed system. This is a general feature of one dimensional systems with local interactions."
